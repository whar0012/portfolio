# WharmbyCreatives Web Portfolio (Tyler Wharmby)

Welcome to the WharmbyCreatives Website Portfolio! Below, I've included some information about my process of building my portfolio, the challenges I faced, and how I solved these issues over time.


## Building Process

- I used XD to establish a high-fidelity wireframe of my expected result.
- I used HTML5 for structuring my content.
- I used CSS3 for styling my layout and design.
- Used JavaScript in Bootstrap to help me with some interactive elements and condensed content.


### My Strengths

1. **Responsive Design:** I made sure my portfolio was accessible and aesthetically pleasing on both web and mobile devices, including most screen sizes.

2. **Code Comments:** I included detailed descriptions and comments throughout my code to keep track of my work and progress.

3. **Contact Form:** I included a simple way for clients of my website to get in touch with me or upload their projects.


## The Challenges I Faced

One of the major challenges I faced was creating a responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices. I tried to solve this issue by using media queries, as I made the mistake of not going for a mobile-first approach. I regularly kept track of and tested my website on both devices throughout coding to ensure I could resolve the issue. Another challenge I faced was trying to build my web portfolio while learning as a beginner at the same time. I overcame this challenge by working with multiple tutors and maintaining a healthy work/life balance. For example, I read up on IMDAC or W3Schools in my spare time or watch coding videos for fun.


## The Lessons I Learned

**Responsive Design Best Practices:** Through building my web portfolio, I learned why it's best to go for a mobile-first approach when designing and starting the project. As I gained more knowledge through my tutor sessions and everyday experiences, I ended up strengthening my skills in simplifying my code and keeping everything as organized and detailed as possible. I also learned lessons on how to correctly manipulate and interact with images and other files in the code, or even just embedding links in places such as navigation bars. Bootstrap also taught me some valuable lessons, such as how to use it to exponentially condense my projects. 

I plan to continuously maintain and update my website portfolio to make room for improvements and even more user-friendly designs and accessibility enhancements, hopefully filling my portfolio with more new beautiful projects and skills over time.
